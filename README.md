# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to build a webpage for myself and other bootcamps students to study from. I built this project to serve as a study guide for the prework from my bootcamp. The project also serves as a great centralized place to store notes from the prework modules. I learned a lot while building this project, including: starting to work with HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript; completing GitHub workflows; and new terminology associated with the project.

## Installation

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage features four sections containing notes for each topic covered in the bootcamp prework modules: HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript.

If the DevTools console in Google Chrome is opened (right-click any element on the page and select inspect, then choose the 'console' tab), JavaScript is shown running. It will list the topics covered in the bootcamp prework and provide a suggestion of which topic to start studying first.
